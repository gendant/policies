# Gendant subprocessors

*Last updated: Feb, 2023*

We use third party subprocessors, such as cloud computing providers and customer support software, to run Gendant (the service). We establish GDPR-compliant data processing agreements with each subprocessor, extending [GDPR safeguards](../index.md) everywhere personal data is processed.

The following is a list of personal data subprocessors we use. These subprocessors are all located in the United States:

* [International Business Machines](https://www.ibm.com/data-responsibility/gdpr/). Cloud services provider.
* [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/gdpr/introduction/). Cloud services provider.
* [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/privacy/). Transactional email service.
* [Plausible](https://plausible.io/data-policy). Analytics service.
